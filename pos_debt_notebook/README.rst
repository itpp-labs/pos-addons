======================
 POS: Prepaid credits
======================

The module allows to make sale on credit.

Debt (Credit) value is changed whenever:

* Product marked as "Credit Product" is sold via POS or via Invoices. Invoices created via website_sale (eCommerce) module are supported too.
* POS payment is made via journal marked as "Debt journal"
* "Manual Credit Updates" is added

Other features:

* each user has Debt Limit field. By default is 0, i.e. user has to pay in advance and cannot have negative credits amount.
* Working with employees of company. You can get a sum of Credits of all employess of any company. You can make invoices per each employee at once to updates their Credits.

Installation \ Deinstallation
=============================

* Debt data are still available after the module will be re-installed.
* When new (first after install) POS session is opened, a debt payment method would added in a POS config.
* If the module was install and uninstall immediately (without created POS sessions) then it keeps no data.
* If a user deleted debt journal from POS config manually then after the module is upgraded
  POS config would not be changed.
* Multicompany mode is supported

Roadmap
=======

* TODO. New option for **Zero transactions** feature: allow to create extra order line with negative amount instead of applying discounts.

  * It creates extra record in accounting system (pos.order.line). It can be used as a backup for *Manual Updates*
  * It works with following problem case:

    In case of purchasing products with taxes not included in the price, such journals cannot be used along with normal payments

* TODO. Improvements on heavy usage (Many POSes, Many Partners)

  * Num of users with cached Debt History must be limited
  * Limit issue in ``reload_debts`` (check FIXME note there)
  * Many POSes do the same requests on getting updates from longpolling. Solution:

    * Customizable timeout in ``on_debt_updates`` method in ``pos_debt_notebook_sync`` module.
    * ``reload_debts`` called with ``"postpone": false`` must ignore existing timer
