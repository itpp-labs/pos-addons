=======================
 Debt notebook for POS
=======================

The module allows to make sale on credit.

The module has the following behavior:

* Debt data are still available after the module will be re-installed.
* When new (first after install) POS session is opened, a debt payment method would added in a POS config.
* Odoo tests are passed.
* Multicompany mode support.
* If the module was install and uninstall immediately (without created POS sessions) then it keeps no data.   
* If a user deleted debt journal from POS config manually then after the module is upgraded 
  POS config would not be changed. 
* Upgrading from old versions is well.
