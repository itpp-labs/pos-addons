The button appears when you select Customer which has unpaid debt (red amount). You can see this button in 2 places: 

* At the top of the Customer's form
* On the payment page
 
When you click ``[Pay Full Debt]`` button, the debt amount will be added to the payment list with negative sign. That negative amount has to be covered by normal payment (e.g. by cash). After that the Customer will have zero debt value.

Credit Products
---------------

* Instead of using Debt Journal, customer can purchase *Credits* via *Credit Products*
* When you create *Credit product*, don't forget to set **Credit Product** field
* *Credit products* can be sold via POS and via invoices (including eCommerce). The later requires `another module <https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/10.0/pos_debt_notebook_sync/>`_ to notify POS about eCommerce sales, otherwise POS will get updates about invoices only after POS reloading.
