                The module allows to make sale on credit in a single
                click. You do not need to take money from a
                customer each time. You'll be able to offer your
                customer make prepayment or pay periodically,
                e.g. once in a month. It's a good solution for small
                shops with regular customers.

                To make repayment of a debt create payment of another
                type, e.g. cash. This payment should be more than

                It's implemented as follows. Addon create payment method
                (Debt journal). When customer buy on credit, he give
                "debt" to cashier, which can be considered as some
                kind of money. This virtual money (debts) is accounted
                just like usual money. But when customer pay debts,
                this virtual money (debts) are moved from debt account
                to cash (or bank) account
            </p>
            <p>
                So, positive amount of debts (debit) means that
                customer have to pay. Negative amount of debts
                (credit) means that customer overpay his debts and can
                take instead some product or take back that money.
