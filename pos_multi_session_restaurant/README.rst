Sync POS orders across multiple sessions (restaurant extension)
===============================================================

Syncs additional restaurant data:

* Table and floor
* Guests number
* Printer status (green "Order" button)
* Notes

Each multi-session and each unsynchronized POS may have its own floor set. POSes in multi-session have same floors.

FIXME: there is issue with floor real-time synchronization, to synchronize tables after modifying them it is mandatory to refresh all POSes pages, also deleting a table with open order on it leads to constant error messages. See https://github.com/it-projects-llc/pos-addons/issues/375.

If you use dbfilter, don't forget to specify correct proxy on printers
